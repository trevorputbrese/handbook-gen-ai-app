Welcome  
Hello  and welcome!  Thank  you for joining  [Company  name ], where  we strive  to [state  
mission  statement  or values .] We can’t  wait to see what you will achieve  with us. 
 
 
 This employee  handbook  defines  who we are and how we work  together.  we will do 
everything  possible  to create  a fair and productive  workplace,  but we need  your help.  
We’ve  created  this handbook  to guide  you. 
 
This handbook  isn’t a contract  or a guarantee  of employment.  It’s a collection  of our 
expectations,  commitments  and responsibilities.  Please  read this employee  handbook  
carefully  and consult  it whenever  you need  to.  
Getting  to know  our company  
[Provide  a brief history  of your company  here.  If possible,  use illustrations  and charts  to 
make  this information  memorable.  Present  your company’s  culture  and vision.  Avoid  
jargon  and overused  phrases  (e.g. “competitive, ” “fast-paced  environment, ” “core 
values”  and “innovative. ”) Also,  it’d be a good  idea to include  quotes  and pictures  of 
your company’ s founders,  CEO  or other  executives  to make  this introduction  more  
personable. ] 
Employment  basics  
In this section,  we explain  our employee  contract  types  and define  our basic  
employment  policies.   
Employment  contract  types  
Full-time employees  work at least  [30 hours ] per week  or [130 hours ] per month  on 
average.  
 
Part-time employees  are those  who work  fewer  than [30 hours ] per week.  
 
Full-time and part-time employees  can have  either  temporary  or indefinite  duration  
contracts.  Full-time employees  under  an indefinite  duration  contract  are entitled  to our 
company’s  full benefits  package.  
 
[Insert  this if employees  are in the U.S: We remind  you that, in the U.S.,  employment  is 
“at-will.” This means  that you or our company  may terminate  our employment  
relationshi p at any time and for any non-discriminatory  reason(s). ] 
 
 Equal  opportunity  employment  
[Company’s  name ] is an equal  opportunity  employer.  We don’t  tolerate  discrimination  
against  protected  characteristics  (gender,  age, sexual  orientation,  race,  nationality,  
ethnicity,  religion,  disability,  veteran  status.)  We want all employees  (including  
executives  and HR) to treat others  with respect  and professionalism.  In practice,  this 
means  that we: 
 
■ [Hire and promote  people  based  on skills,  experience  or potential  and try to 
reduce  bias in every  process  (e.g. through  structured  interviews.) ] 
 
■ [Make  accommodations  to help people  with disabilities  move  about  safely  on our 
premises  and use our products,  services  and equipment .] 
 
■ [Use inclusive,  diversity -sensitive  language  in all official  documents,  signs  and job 
ads.] 
 
■ [Conduct  diversity  and communication  training .] 
 
Apart  from those  actions,  we commit  to penalizing  every  discriminatory,  offensive  or 
inappropriate  behavior.  To do this properly,  we ask you to report  any discriminatory  
action  against  yourself  or your colleagues  to HR. Our company  will not retaliate  again st 
you if you file a complaint  or discrimination  lawsuit.  Any employee  who retaliates  or 
discriminates  will face disciplinary  action.  
Recruitment  and selection  process  
Our hiring  steps  might  vary across  roles,  but we always  aim for a process  that is fair and 
effective  in hiring  great  people.  If you are hiring  for an open  role, you will likely  go 
through  these  steps:  
 
i. Identify  the need  for a new job opening.  
ii. Decide  whether  to hire externally  or internally.  
iii. Review  job descriptions  and write  a job ad. 
iv. Get approval for your job ad. 
v. Select  appropriate  sources  (external  or internal)  to post your job opening.  
vi. Decide  on hiring  stages  and possible  timeframes.  
vii. Review  resumes  in our company  database/ATS.  
viii. Source  passive  candidates.  
ix. Shortlist  applicants.  
 
 x. Screen  and interview candidates.  
xi. Run background  checks  and check  references.  
xii. Select  the most  suitable  candidate.  
xiii. Make  an official  offer.  
 
Steps  may overlap,  so skip steps  when  appropriate.  Each  member  of a hiring  team  
might  have  different  responsibilities  (e.g. recruiters  source  and hiring  managers  
interview  candidates.)  
 
Throughout  this process,  we aim to keep  candidates  informed,  communicate  well with 
each  other  and give everyone  an equal  opportunity  to work  with us. Ask our recruiters  
for help whenever  you need  to enhan ce candidate  experience  or write an inclusive  job 
description.  
Background  checks  
If you want to run background  checks  on candidates,  ask HR for guidance.  This process  
is sensitive  and we must  always  abide  by laws and ensure  candidates  understand  our 
intent ions.  As a general  rule, commission  a background  check  for finalists  only.  Use our 
contracted  provider  and ensure  you have  your candidates’  permission.  
Referrals   
If you know  someone  who you think  would  be a good  fit for a position  at our company,  
feel free to refer them.  If we end up hiring  your referred  candidate,  you are eligible  for 
[$3000 ] referral  bonus  or [a trip to a destination  of your choice/  Amazon  coupons .] Our 
employee  referral  rewards  may be higher  if we hire your referred  candidate  in a hard-to-
fill role. For example,  if we hire your referral  for the position  of [Data  Scientist ], you may 
receive  [$6000 .] 
 
Additional  rules  for rewards:  
 
■ We guarantee  that every  reward  will be paid out within  [a month ] of the date we 
hired  a candidate.  
 
■ There  is no cap on the number  of referrals  an employee  can make.  All rewards  
will be paid accordingly.  
 
■ If two or more  employees  refer the same  candidate,  only the first referrer  will 
receive  the referral  incentives.  
 
 
 ■ Referrers  are still eligible  for rewar ds even  if a candidate  is hired  at a later time or 
gets hired  for another  position.  
 
Who  can be referred?  
 
We have  two conditions  for candidates  who can qualify  you for our rewards.  They  
should:  
■ Have  not applied  to our company  for at least  a year.  
■ Be hired  as permanent  full- or part-time employees  (not as temporary  employees  
or contractors.)  
 
Our company  may use an online  form or a platform  where  employees  may refer 
candidates.  You can also reach  out directly  to our [HR/recruiters/Talent  Acquisition  
Manager ] with referrals.  
 
Generally,  we encourage  you to check  our open  positions  and consider  your social  
networks  and external  networks  as potential  resources  for referred  candidates.  
 
Keep  in mind  that rewards  may be subject  to taxation.  Please  contact  HR or our referral  
program  manager  for more  information.  
Attendance  
We expect  you to be present  during  your scheduled  working  hours.  If you face an 
emergency  that prevents  you from coming  to work  one day, contact  your manager  as 
soon  as possible.  We will excuse  unreported  absences  in cases  of [serious  accidents,  
acute  medical  emergencies .] But, whenever  possible,  we should  know  when  you won’t  
be coming  in. 
Workplace  policies  
This section  describes  policies  that apply  to everyone  at our company:  employees,  
contract ors, volunteers,  vendors  and stakeholders  alike.  These  policies  help us build  a 
productive,  lawful  and pleasant  workplace.   
Confidentiality  and data protection  
We want to ensure  that private  information  about  clients,  employees,  partners  and our 
company  is well-protected.  Examples  of confidential  information  are: 
 
 
 ■ Employee  records  
■ Unpublished  financial  information  
■ Data  of customers/partners/vendors  
■ Customer  lists (existing  and prospective)  
■ Unpublished  goals,  forecasts  and initiatives  marked  as confidential  
 
As part of our hiring  process,  we may ask you to sign non-compete  and non-disclosure  
agreements  (NDAs.)  We are also committed  to: 
 
■ Restrict  and monitor  access  to sensitive  data.  
■ Develop  transparent  data collection  procedures.  
■ Train  employees  in online  privacy  and security  measures.  
■ Build  secure  networks  to protect  online  data from cyberattacks.  
■ Establish  data protection  practices  (e.g. secure  locks,  data encryption,  frequent  
backups,  access  authorization.)  
 
We also expect  you to act responsibly  when  handling  confidential  information.  
 
You must:  
■ Lock  or secure  confidential  information  at all times.  
■ Shred  confidential  documents  when  they’re  no longer  needed.  
■ Make  sure you view confidential  information  on secure  devices  only.  
■ Only disclo se information  to other  employees  when  it’s necessary  and 
authorized.  
■ Keep  confidential  documents  inside  our company’s  premises  unless  it’s 
absolutely  necessary  to move  them.  
 
You must  not: 
■ Use confidential  information  for your personal  benefit  or profit.  
■ Disclose  confidential  information  to anyone  outside  of our company.  
■ Replicate  confidential  documents  and files and store  them  on insecure  devices.  
 
This policy  is important  for our company’ s legality  and reputation.  We will terminate  any 
employee  who breaches  our confidentiality  guidelines  for personal  profit.   
 
 
 We may also discipline  any unintentional  breach  of this policy  depending  on its 
frequency  and seriousness.  We will terminate  employ ees who repeatedly  disregard  this 
policy,  even  when  they do so unintentionally.  
Harassment  and violence  
To build  a happy  and productive  workplace,  we need  everyone  to treat others  well and 
help them  feel safe.  Each  of us should  do our part to prevent  haras sment  and 
workplace  violence.  
Workplace  harassment  
Harassment  is a broad  term and may include  seemingly  harmless  actions,  like gossip.  
We can’t  create  an exhaustive  list, but here are some  instances  that we consider  
harassment:  
 
■ [Sabotaging  someone’s  work  on purpose .] 
■ [Engaging  in frequent  or unwanted  advances  of any nature .] 
■ [Commenting  derogatorily  on a person’s  ethnic  heritage  or religious  beliefs .] 
■ [Starting  or spreading  rumors  about  a person’s  personal  life.] 
■ [Ridiculing  someone  in front of others  or singling  them  out to perform  tasks  
unrelated  to their job (e.g. bringing  coffee)  against  their will.] 
 
Sexual  harassment  is illegal  and we will seriously  investigate  relevant  reports.  If an 
employee  is found  guilty  of sexual  harassment,  they will be terminated.  
 
If you’re  being  harassed,  whether  by a colleague,  customer  or vendor,  you can choose  
to talk to any of these  people:  
 
■ Offenders . If you suspect  that an offender  doesn’t  realize  they are guilty  of 
harassment,  you could  talk to them  directly  in an effort  to resolve  the harassment.  
This tactic  is appropriate  for cases  of minor  harassment  (e.g. inappropriate  jokes  
between  colleagues.)  Avoid  using  this approach  with customers  or stakeholders.  
 
■ Your  manager . If customers,  stakeholders  or team  mem bers are involved  in your 
claim,  you may reach  out to your manager.  Your manager  will assess  your 
situation  and may contact  HR if appropriate.  
 
 
 ■ HR. Feel free to reach  out to HR in any case  of harassment  no matter  how minor  
it may seem.  For your safety,  contact HR as soon  as possible  in cases  of serious  
harassment  (e.g. sexual  advances)  or if your manager  is involved  in your claim.  
Anything  you disclose  will remain  confidential.  
Workplace  violence  
Violence  in our workplace  is a serious  form of harassment.  It includes  physical  and 
sexual  assault,  destruction  of property,  threats  to harm  a person  or property  and verbal  
and psychological  abuse.  We want to avoid  those  incidents  altogether,  but we also want  
to be ready  to respond  if needed.  
 
For this reason,  we ask you to: 
 
■ [Report  to HR if you suspect  or know  that someone  is being  violent.  Your  report  
will be confidential  and we will investigate  the situation  with discretion. ] 
 
■ [Call our building’s  security  if you witness  incidents  of severe  physical  violence  
(e.g. ones  that involve  a lethal  weapon.)  For your safety,  avoid  getting  involved .] 
 
We will treat employees  who verbally  threaten  others  as high risk and they will receive  
an appropriate  penalty.  If HR finds  that an employee  commits  an act of violence,  we will 
terminate  that employee  and possibly  press  criminal  charges.  Employees  who damage  
property  deliberately  will be solely  responsible  for paying  for it.  
 
Supporting  victims  
To support  victims  of workplace  violence,  we may:  
■ [Cover  relevant  medi cal bills.] 
■ [Pay for mental  health  treatment  if needed. ]  
■ [Provide  victims  with our lawyer’s  services  to help them  file lawsuits. ]  
 
Get help early  on 
Seek  help from others  early  on to mitigate  conflicts.  For example:   
 
■ If you experience  conflicts  with a colleague,  ask your manager  for advice  before  
tensions  escalate.  If these  conflicts  persist,  ask HR whether  you could  attend  
conflict  resolution  seminars  with your colleague.  
 
 
 ■ If you are experiencing  personal  or work troubles,  ask for help from a [mental  
health  professional .] Check  with your insurance  provider  to determine  whether  
they cover  any mental  health  services  or ask HR for information  on our Employee  
Assistance  Program  (EAP).  Your  discussions  will remain  confidential.  
 
Our workplace  is founded on mutual  respect  and we won’t  allow  anyone  to compromise  
this foundation.  
Workplace  safety  and health  
Our company  is committed  to creating  a hazard -free workplace.  To this end, we will 
ensure  workplace  safety  through  preventative  action  and emergency  management.   
 
Preventative  action  
Preventative  actions  are any actions  we take to avoid  injuries  or illnesses  related  to the 
workplace.  We will periodically  conduct  risk assessments  and job hazard  analyses  
[through  a workplace  safety  committee ] to uncover  health  risks to employees.  And we 
will establish  preventative  measures  to address  risks accordingly.  
 
At a minimum,  we will: 
■ [Hold employee  training  sessions  on safety  standards  and procedures .] 
■ [Make  sure employees  who work  in dangerous  locations  are safe. ] 
■ [Provide  protective  gear like gloves,  protective  uniforms  and goggles. ] 
■ [Direct  inspectors  and quality  control  employees  to evaluate  equipment  and 
infrastructure  regularly. ] 
 
We also expect  you to take safety  seriously.  Always  use protective  equipme nt and 
follow  standards  whenever  necessary.  If you deliberately  disregard  our guidelines,  we 
may terminate  you for your own and others’  safety.  
Emergency  management  
Emergency  management  refers  to our plan to deal with sudden  catastrophes  like fire, 
floods,  earthquakes  or explosions.  Our emergency  management  provisions  include:  
■ [Functional  smoke  alarms  and sprinklers  that are regularly  inspected. ] 
■ [Technicians  (external  or internal)  available  to repair  leakages,  damages  and 
blackouts  quickly. ] 
■ [Fire extingui shers  and other  fire protection  equipment  that are easily  accessible. ] 
 
 ■ [An evacuation  plan posted  on each  floor and online. ] 
■ [Fire escapes  and safety  exits that are clearly  indicated .] 
Smoking  
[Company’s  name ] is a smoke -free workplace.  You can smoke  in [designated  smoking  
areas,  balconies,  open -air verandas  and outer  premises,  like gardens  and sidewalks. ] 
Any other  area in our workplace  (like restrooms,  lobby,  offices,  staircases,  warehouses)  
is strictly  smoke -free to protect  non-smokers.  
 
We also advise  you to: 
■ Extinguish  your cigarettes  and discard  them  in [outdoor  ashtrays,  cigarette  urns. ] 
■ Avoid  smoking  when  you have  scheduled  meetings  with clients  or vendors.  
■ Avoid  smoking  near flammable  objects  and areas.  
 
Setting  off fire alarms  and causing  fires by smoking  are serious  offenses.  If you are 
found  responsible,  you may face disciplinary  action  up to and including  termination.  
Drug -free workplace  
[Company’s  name ] is a drug-free workplace.  Whether  you are an employee,  contractor  
or visitor,  you must  not bring, use, give away  or sell any drugs  on company  premises.  If 
you are caught  with illegal  drugs,  or show  that you are under  the influence  of 
substances,  you will face disciplinary  action  up to and including  termination.   
 
A list of prohibited  drugs  and substances  includes,  but isn’t limited  to: 
 
■ [heroin/cocaine/methamphetamine  in any form] 
■ [marijuana ]  
 
Alcohol  
We prohibit  employees  from consuming  alcohol  during  working  hours,  but they may 
consume  alcoholic  drinks  in moderation  at company  events.  
 
Prescr iption  drugs  
If you feel that a prescription  drug (e.g. an anxiety  mediation)  unexpectedly  affects  your 
senses,  thinking  or movement,  ask for the rest of your day off. If your manager  suspects  
substance  abuse,  you may face disciplinary  action.  
 
 
 You [must  not] use medical  marijuana  in our workplace.  We have  the right to terminate  
you if your off-duty use of medical  marijuana  makes  you unable  to complete  your job 
duties  correctly.   
 
We expect  employees  who hold safety -sensitive  jobs (e.g. machine  operators  or 
drivers)  to be fully alert and capable  of performing  their duties  at all times.  We may 
terminate  you if we conclude  your prescription  drug use creates  severe  safety  risks.  If 
you need  to use prescription  drugs  for a limited  time and you think  they may impair your 
abilities,  use your PTO or sick leave.  
 
If your job includes  secondary  tasks  that are safety -sensitive  and your prescribed  drugs  
affect  your ability  to perform  these  tasks,  we can make  reasonable  accommodations  to 
ensure  you and your colleagues’  safety.   
 
Dealing  with addiction  
Being  sober  is a prerequisite  to thriving  at our company  and we want  to help you as 
much  as possible.  We offer Employee  Assistance  Programs  (EAP)  that can help 
employees  overcome  addictions.  If you face a releva nt problem,  please  reach  out to our 
[EAP Officer .]  
 
We won’t  tolerate  substance  addiction  that results  in violent,  offensive  or inappropriate  
behavior.  
Employee  Code  of Conduct  
As an employee,  all company  policies  mentioned  above  apply  to you. We have  some 
additional  expectations  about  your behavior  at work,  which  we outline  here.  We can’t  
cover  every  single  case  of conduct,  but we trust you to always  use your best judgement.  
Reach  out to your manager  or HR if you face any issues  or have  any questions.  
Dress code  
Our company’s  official  dress  code  is [Business/  Business  Casual/  Smart  Casual/  
Casual .] This includes  [slacks/  loafers/  blouses/  boots. ] However,  an employee’s  
position  may also inform  how they should  dress.  If you frequently  meet  with clients  or 
prospects,  conform  to a more  formal  dress  code.  We expect  you to be clean  when  
coming  to work and avoid  wearing  clothes  that are unprofessional  (e.g. workout  
clothes.)  
 
 
 As long as you conform  with our guidelines  above,  we don’t  have  specific  expectations  
about what types  of clothes  or accessories  you should  wear.  
 
We also respect  and permit  grooming  styles,  clothing  and accessories  that are dictated  
by religious  beliefs,  ethnicity  or disability.   
Cyber  security  and digital  devices  
This section  deals  with all things  digital  at work.  We want to set some  guidelines  for 
using  computers,  phones,  our internet  connection  and social  media  to ensure  security  
and protect  our assets.  
Internet  usage  
Our corporate  internet  connection  is primarily  for business.  But, you can occasionally  
use our connection  for personal  purposes  as long as they don’t  interfere  with your job 
responsibilities.  Also,  we expect  you to temporarily  halt personal  activities  that slow 
down  our internet  connection  (e.g. uploading  photos)  if you’re  asked  to. 
 
You must  not use our internet  connection  to: 
■ Downlo ad or upload  obscene,  offensive  or illegal  material.  
■ Send  confidential  information  to unauthorized  recipients.  
■ Invade  another  person’s  privacy  and gain access  to sensitive  information.  
■ Download  or upload  pirated  movies,  music,  material  or software.  
■ Visit potentially  dangerous  websites  that can compromise  our network  and 
computers’  safety.  
■ Perform  unauthorized  or illegal  actions,  like hacking,  fraud  or buying/selling  illegal  
goods.  
Cell phone  
We allow  use of cell phones  at work.  But, we also want to ensure  that your devices  
won’t  distract  you from your work or disrupt  our workplace.  We ask you to follow  a few 
simple  rules:  
 
■ Use your cell phone  in a manner  that benefits  your work  (business  calls,  
productivity  apps,  calendars.)  
 
■ Keep  personal  calls brief and use an empty  meeting  room  or common  area so as 
not to disturb  your colleagues.  
 
  
■ Avoid  playing  games  on your phone  or texting  excessively.  
 
■ Avoid  using  your phone  for any reason  while  driving  a company  vehicle.  
 
■ Don’t use your phone  to record  confidential  information.  
 
■ Don’t download  or upload  inappropriate,  illegal  or obscene  material  using  our 
corporate  internet  connection.  
 
Also,  you must  not use your phone  in areas  where  cell phone  use is explicitly  prohibited  
(e.g. laboratories.)  
Corporate  email  
Email  is essential  to our work.  You should  use your company  email  primarily  for work,  
but we allow  some  uses  of your company  email  for personal  reasons.  
 
■ Work -related  use. You can use your corporate  email  for work -related  purposes  
without  limitations.  For example,  you can sign up for newsletters  and online  
services  that will help you in your job or professional  growth.  
 
■ Personal  use. You can use your email  for personal  reasons  as long as you keep  
it safe,  and avoid  spamming  and disclosing  confidential  information.  For example,  
you can send  emails  to friends  and family  and download  ebooks,  guides  and 
other  safe content  for your personal  use. 
 
Our general  expectations  
No matter  how you use your corporate  email,  we expect  you to avoid:  
■ Signing  up for illegal,  unreliable,  disreputable  or suspect  websites  and services.  
■ Sending  unauthorized  marketing  content  or emails.  
■ Registering  for a competitor’s  services,  unless  authorized.  
■ Sending  insulting  or discriminatory  messages  and content.  
■ Intentionally  spamming  other  people’s  emails,  including  your coworkers.  
 
In general,  use strong  passwords  and be vigilant  in catching  emails  that carry  malware  
or phishing  attempts.  If you are not sure that an email  you received  is safe,  ask our 
[Security  Specialists .] 
 
 Social  media  
We want to provide  practical  advice  to prevent  careless  use of social  media  in our 
workplace.  
 
We address  two types  of social  media  uses:  using  personal  social  media  at work and 
representing  our company  through  social  media.  
 
Using personal  social  media  at work  
You are permitted  to access  your personal  accounts  at work.  But, we expect  you to act 
responsibly,  according  to our policies  and ensure  that you stay productive.  Specifically,  
we ask you to: 
■ Discipline  yourself . Avoid  getting  sidetracked  by your social  platforms.  
 
■ Ensure  others  know  that your  personal  account  or statements  don’t  
represent  our company.  For example,  use a disclaimer  such  as “opinions  are 
my own.”  
 
■ Avoid  sharing  intellectual  property  (e.g trademarks)  or confidential  
information . Ask your manager  or PR first before  you share  company  news  
that’s  not officially  announced.  
 
■ Avoid  any defamatory,  offensive  or derogatory  content . You may violate  our 
company’s  anti-harassment  policy  if you direct  such  content  towards  colleagues,  
clients  or partners.  
 
Representing  our company  through  social  media  
If you handle  our social  media  accounts  or speak  on our company’s  behalf,  we expect  
you to protect  our company’s  image  and reputation.  Specifically,  you should:  
 
■ Be respectful,  polite  and patient.  
■ Avoid  speaking  on matters  outside  your field of expertise  when  possible.  
■ Follow  our confidentiality  and data protection  policies  and observe  laws 
governing  copyrights,  trademarks,  plagiarism  and fair use. 
■ Coordinat e with our [PR/Marketing  department ] when  you’re  about  to share  any 
major -impact  content.  
■ Avoid  deleting  or ignoring  comments  for no reason.  
■ Correct  or remove  any misleading  or false  content  as quickly  as possible.  
 
 Conflict  of interest  
When  you are experie ncing  a conflict  of interest,  your personal  goals  are no longer  
aligned  with your responsibilities  towards  us. For example,  accepting  a bribe  may 
benefit  you financially,  but it is illegal  and against  our business  code  of ethics.  If we 
become  aware  of such  behaviour,  you will lose your job and may face legal  trouble.  
 
For this reason,  conflicts  of interest  are a serious  issue  for all of us. We expect  you to 
be vigilant  to spot circumstances  that create  conflicts  of interest,  either  to yourself  or for 
your direct reports.  Follow  our policies  and always  act in our company’s  best interests.  
Whenever  possible,  do not let personal  or financial  interests  get in the way of your job. If 
you are experiencing  an ethical  dilemma,  talk to your manager  or HR and we will try to 
help you resolve  it. 
Employee  relationships  
We want to ensure  that relationships  between  employees  are appropriate  and 
harmonious.  We outline  our guidelines  and we ask you to always  behave  professionally.   
Fraternization  
Fraternization  refers  to dating or being  friends  with your colleagues.  In this policy,  
“dating”  equals  consensual  romantic  relationships  and sexual  relations.  Non-consensual  
relationships  constitute  sexual  violence  and we prohibit  them  explicitly.  
 
Dating  colleagues  
If you start dating  a colleague,  we expect  you to maintain  professionalism  and keep  
personal  discussions  outside  of our workplace.  
 
You are also obliged  to respect  your colleagues  who date each  other.  We won’t  tolerate  
sexual  jokes,  malicious  gossip  and improper  comments.  If you witness  this kind of 
behavior,  please  report  it to HR. 
 
Dating  managers  
To avoid  accusations  of favoritism,  abuse  of authority  and sexual  harassment,  
supervisors  must  not date their direct  reports.  This restriction  extends  to every  manager  
above  an employee.  
 
Also,  if you act as a hiring  manager,  you aren’t  allowed  to hire your partner  to your 
team.  You can refer them  for employment  to other  teams  or departments  where  you 
don’t  have  any managerial  or hiring  authority.  
 
  
Friendships  at work  
Employees  who work  together  may naturally  form friendships  either  in or outside  of the 
workplace.  We encourage  this relationship  between  peers,  as it can help you 
communicate  and collaborate.  But, we expect  you to focus  on your work and keep  
personal  disputes  outside  of our workplace.  
Employment  of relatives  
Everyone  in our company  should  be hired,  recognized  or promoted  because  of their 
skills,  character  and work ethic.  We would  not like to see phenomena  of nepotism,  
favoritism  or conflicts  of intere st, so we will place  some  restrictions  on hiring  employees’  
relatives.  
 
To our company,  a “relative” is someone  who is related  by blood  or marriage  within  the 
third degree  to an employee.  This includes:  parents,  grandparents,  in-laws,  spouses  or 
domestic  partners,  children,  grandchildren,  siblings,  uncles,  aunts,  nieces,  nephews,  
step-parents,  step-children  and adopted  children.  
 
As an employee,  you can refer your relatives  to work  with our company.  Here  are our 
only restrictions:  
 
■ [You must  not be involved  in a supervisory/reporting  relationship  with a relative. ] 
■ [You cannot  be transferred,  promoted  or hired  inside  a reporting  relationship  with 
a relative. ] 
■ [You cannot  be part of a hiring  committee,  when  your relative  is interviewed  for 
that posit ion.] 
 
If you become  related  to a manager  or direct  report  after you both become  employed  by 
our company,  we may have  to [transfer  one of you.] 
Workplace  visitors  
If you want to invite  a visitor  to our offices,  please  ask for permission  from our  [HR 
Manag er/ Security  Officer/  Office  Manager ] first. Also,  inform  our [reception/  gate/  front-
office ] of your visitor’s  arrival.  Visitors  should  sign in and show  identification.  They  will 
receive  passes  and will be asked  to return  them  to [reception/  gate/  front-office] once  
their visit is complete.  
 
When  you have  office  visitors,  you also have  responsibilities.  You should:  
 
 ■ Always  tend to your visitors  (especially  when  they are underage.)  
 
■ Keep  your visitors  away  from areas  where  there  are dangerous  machines,  
chemicals,  confidential  records  or sensitive  equipment.  
 
■ Prevent  your visitors  from proselytizing  your colleagues,  gathering  donations  or 
requesting  participation  in activities  while  on our premises.  
 
Anyone  who delivers  orders,  mail or packages  for employees  should  remain  at our 
building’s  reception  or gate.  If you are expecting  a delivery,  [front office  employees/  
security  guards ] will notify  you so you may collect  it. 
Solicitation  and distribution  
Solicitation  is any form of requesting  money,  support  or participation  for products,  
groups,  organizations  or causes  which  are unrelated  to our company  (e.g. religious  
proselytism,  asking  for petition  signatures.)  Distribution  means  dissemina ting literature  
or material  for commercial  or political  purposes.  
 
We don’t  allow  solicitation  and distribution  by non-employees  in our workplace.  As an 
employee,  you may solicit  from your colleagues  only when  you want  to: 
 
■ Ask colleagues  to help organize  events  for another  employee  (e.g. adoption/birth  
of a child,  promotion,  retiring.)  
■ Seek  support  for a cause,  charity  or fundraising  event  sponsored,  funded,  
organized  or authorized  by our company.  
■ Invite  colleagues  to employee  activities  for an authorized  non-business  purpose  
(e.g. recreation,  volunteering.)  
■ Ask colleagues  to participate  in employment -related  activities  or groups  protected  
by law (e.g. trade  unions.)  
 
In all cases,  we ask that you do not disturb  or distract  colleagues  from their work.   
Comp ensation  & development  
In this section,  we outline  our guidelines  for compensating  employees  according  to their 
employment  status.  We also describe  our performance  management  and employee  
development  policies.  
 
 Compensation  status  
[Insert  this section  if you are covered  by the Fair Labor  Standards  Act (FLSA)  in the 
U.S.] 
 
There  are two types  of employees  under  FLSA  guidelines:  
 
■ Non-exempt  employees,  who are covered  by the FLSA’s  minimum  wage  and 
overtime  provisions.   
 
■ Exempt  employees,  who aren’t  covered  by the FLSA  because  they meet  three  
exemption  criteria:  (a) they are paid at least  [$23,600 ] per year ([$455 ] per week),  
(b) they are paid on a salary  basis,  and (c) they perform  exempt  job duties  
("executive,"  "professional"  and "admin istrative.")  Most  employees  must  meet  all 
three  criteria  to be exempt.  
 
If you are unsure  as to whether  you should  be exempt  or not, please  ask HR to clarify  
your status.  
 
The FLSA  excludes  some  types  of jobs (e.g. railroad  workers,  truck  drivers)  because  
they are covered  by other  federal  laws.  Some  other  workers,  like outside  salespeople,  
are excluded  by definition.  Feel free to ask HR for clarifications  any time.  
Overtime  
Occasionally,  we may need  you to work  more  than your regular  working  hours.  We will 
pay for overtime  work according  to local and national  laws.   
 
[Insert  this if employees  are in the U.S: If you are an exempt  employee,  you are not 
entitled  to overtime  pay by federal  law. In the event  that an exempt  employee  must  work  
overtime,  we will set a cap for overtime  hours  at [10 hours  per week ] to prevent  
overworking  and burnout.  
  
If you are a non-exempt  employee,  you are entitled  to overtime  pay of one and a half 
times  your wage.  Please  record  your overtime  hours  accurately,  so we can calculate  
your pay correctly.  We also ask you to work  overtime  only after it’s authorized  by your 
supervisor  to make  our record -keeping  easier .] 
 
 Payroll  
We pay your salary  or wage  [at the end of month/  every  15th and end of month ] by 
[checks/  bank  transfers/  cash .] If you are an hourly  employee,  you should  be diligent  [in 
clocking  in and out/using  our timesheet  softwar e] so we can accurately  calculate  your 
pay. 
Performance  management  
We have  built our performance  management  practices  to: 
■ Ensure  you understand  your job responsibilities  and have  specific  goals  to meet.  
■ Provide  you with actionable  and timely feedback  on your work.  
■ Invest  in development  opportunities  that help you grow  professionally.  
■ Recognize  and reward  your work  in financial  or non-financial  ways  (e.g. 
employee  awards.)  
 
To meet  these  objectives,  we have:  
■ Established  [annual/  bi-annual/  quarterly ] performance  reviews.  During  these  
reviews,  your manager  will fill out your performance  evaluation  report  and 
arrange  a meeting  with you to discuss  it. Through  these  discussions,  managers  
aim to recognize  employees  who are good  at their jobs,  identify areas  of 
improvement  and talk about  career  moves.  Pay increases  or bonuses  are not 
guaranteed.  But, we encourage  managers  to recommend  rewards  for their team  
members  when  they deserve  them.  There  won’t  be any forced  ranking  or other  
comparison  between  employees,  as our goal is to help all employees  improve  
and develop  their careers.  
 
■ Instructed  all managers  to meet  with their team  members  once  per [week ] to 
provide  feedback  and talk about  their work and motivations.  This way, you can 
receive  feedback  in a timely  manner  and avoid  surprises  during  your [annual/  bi-
annual/  quarterly ] performance  review.  
How we expect  managers  to lead employees  
If you manage  a team,  you are responsible  for your team  members’  performance.  To 
conduct  effective  regular  meetings  and performance  evaluations,  we expect  you to: 
 
■ Set clear  objectives . Your team  members  should  know  what  you expect  of 
them.  When  you first hire someone  to your team,  ensure  they understand  their 
job duties.  Set specific  goals  for each  team  member  (and team -wide if 
 
 applicable.)  Revisit  those  goals  during  [annual/  bi-annual / quarterly ] performance  
reviews.   
 
■ Provide  useful  feedback . During  scheduled  meetings  with your team  members,  
give them  both guidance  and praise,  as appropriate.  Be fair and specific  to help 
them  understand  and implement  your feedback.  
 
■ Keep  your  team  mem bers  involved . There  should  be two-way communication  
between  you and your team.  Make  your expectations  clear,  but always  take your 
team  members’  motivations  and aspirations  into account.  Discuss  training  and 
development  opportunities  that may interest  your team  members.  
 
■ Keep  logs with important  incidents  about  each  one of your  team  members . 
These  logs help you evaluate  your team,  but may also prove  useful  when  
rewarding,  promoting  or terminating  your team  members.  
Employee  training  and development  
We owe our success  to our employees.  To show  our gratitude,  we will invest  in our 
employees  professional  development.  We want employees  to feel confident  about  
improving  their efficiency  and productivity.  We also want to help our employees  achieve  
personal  growth  and success.  
 
Each  employee  has [$1,000 ] annually  to spend  on educational  activities  or material.  
Subscriptions  and books  are included  in this budget,  unless  they are necessary  for you 
to complete  your everyday  duties.  Send  your expenses  to HR [by email/  expenses  
software. ]  
 
Apart  from online  courses,  we offer these  training  opportunities:  
■ Formal  training  sessions  (individual  or corporate.)  
■ Employee  coaching  and mentoring.  
■ Seats  at industry  conferences.  
■ On-the-job training.  
■ Job shadowing.  
■ Job rotation.  
 
 
 Development  is a collective  process.  Team  members  and managers  should  regularly  
discuss  learning  needs  and opportunities.  And it’s HR’s  responsibility  to facilitate  any 
development  activities  and processes.  
Benefits  and perks  
In this section,  we describe  what we offer to our employees.  We provide  information  on 
our health  insurance  plans  and benefits  like work  from home  options  and company -
issued  equipment.  
Employee  health  
Employee  health  is important  to us. We don’t  discriminate  against  people  with 
disabilit ies or health  conditions,  but we want  to do everything  possible  to help 
employees  stay healthy.  At a minimum,  we provide  [group  health  insurance ] to all 
eligible  employees.  For more  information  about  our insurance  package,  contact  HR. 
 
[Insert  this if you have  more  than 20 employees  in the U.S: According  to the 
Consolidated  Omnibus  Budget  Reconciliation  Act (COBRA),  you may choose  to 
continue  your group  health  benefits  for a limited  period  after leaving  our company.  This 
can happen  after you experience  a qualifying  event,  i.e. termination  for reasons  other  
than gross  misconduct  and reduction  in your hours  of employment.  Covered  spouses  
and children  may also be able to extend  their health  coverage  after certain  qualifying  
events.  Please  ask HR for guidance. ] 
 
We have  also established  non-smoking  and substance  abuse  policies  to protect  
employee  health.  We will create  a workplace  with minimal  noise  and good  lighting  and 
offer [free healthy  snacks,  wellness  programs. ] 
Workers’  compensation  
We strive  to keep  our workplace  safe,  but accidents  may happen  occasionally.  
Employees  who are injured  at work (by accident  or disease)  can receive  wage  
replacement,  medical  care and rehabilitation  benefits  according  to workers’  
compensation  laws,  when  appropriate.  Please  inform  us of your injury  as soon  as 
possible.  Ask HR for forms  that you need  to file a claim  or contact  your state  agency  for 
workers’  compensation.  
 
Our company  has a workers’  compensation  policy  according  to guidelines  of the states  
(or countries)  we operate in. [Insert  summary  of your workers  compensation  insurance  
 
 packages  and details  on who will handle  workers’  compensation  when  employees  are 
injured.  If you operate  in multiple  states  or countries,  mention  any specific  guidelines  
and, if possible,  provi de employees  with contact  details  of workers  compensation  
boards  for the states  or countries  you operate  in.] 
Work  from home  
If your job doesn’t  require  you to be present  at our premises,  you can occasionally  work  
from home  (WFH).  We normally  allow  [one day per week .] If you need  to telecommute  
for more  days  per week,  talk to your manager.   
 
Please  inform  your manager  that you want  to work  from home  [using  our HRIS ] at least  
[two days ] in advance.  [You can also set a recurring  WFH  day per week .] If there’s  a 
rare emergency,  you may work from home  without  having  received  prior approval,  but 
call or email  your manager  as soon  as possible.  If they are in a different  time-zone,  
contact  HR instead.  
 
When  you are working  from home,  please  use an internet  connectio n and devices  that 
are fast and secure.  Choose  a place  without  loud noises  or distractions.  And, check  in 
with your team  frequently  to make  collaboration  easier.  
 
If there  is inclement  weather  (e.g. a blizzard)  please  check  your [email ] to see if the 
office is officially  closed.  If you judge  that your commute  during  inclement  weather  is 
dangerous,  let us know.  We will not force  you to come  to work if your safety  is at stake  
or if there  is an official  travel  warning.  
Remote  working  
Remote  working  refers  to working  from a non-office  location  on a temporary  or 
permanent  basis.   
 
If you’re  an office -based  employee,  you may work  remotely  for a maximum  of [two 
consecutive  weeks ] per year.  You may arrange  this if you [are a new parent  or suffer  
from a short -term disability .] If you have  another  reason,  talk to your manager.  Submit  
your remote  working  requests  [through  our HRIS ] at least  [one week ] in advance.  
 
If you work remotely  permanently,  we ask that you adhere  to our security,  confidentiality  
and equal  opportu nity policies  just like your office -based  colleagues.   
 
 Employee  expenses  
There  are some  expenses  that we will pay directly  on your behalf  (e.g. hotel  rooms  for 
work -related  travel.)  But, we ask you to keep  track  and report  on those  reimbursable  
expenses  that you pay yourself.  We reimburse  employee  expenses  that are related  to: 
■ [Business  travel ] 
■ [Relocation ] 
■ [Education  and training ] 
■ [Upon  approval,  outings  with business  partners  or colleagues ] 
 
Not all travel  expenses  are reimbursable.  For example,  we will pay for your 
transportation  to an airport  for work-related  travel,  but not to a museum  for a personal  
visit. Before  traveling  for business,  contact  HR to clarify  which  expenses  are 
reimbursable  within  your particular  trip. 
 
Please  keep  receipts  for all reimbursable  expenses.  You can submit  them  to your 
manager  [through  our expense  software ] within  [three  months ] after the date of each  
expense.  If your manager  approves  your expenses,  you will receive  your 
reimbursement  within  [two] pay periods  [by check .] 
Company  car 
You may drive  a company  car if you: 
 
■ Need  it as an indispensable  part of your job (e.g. truck  drivers  and delivery  
drivers.)  
■ Receive  it as a benefit  attached  to your job. 
 
Either  way, your car belongs  to our company.  You may use your company  vehicle  for 
personal  reasons  as our policy  permits.  You will get reimbursed  only for approved,  
business -related  expenses.  
 
To get a company  car, you should  have  a valid driver’s  license  and a clean  driving  
record  for at least  [two years .] Drive safe and sober  and respect  traffic  laws and fellow  
motorists.  You should  also check  your car regularly  to ensure  gas, tire pressure  and all 
car fluids  are at appropriate  levels.   
 
We expect  you to avoid:  
■ Smoking  in a company  car. 
 
 ■ Leasing,  selling  or lending  a company  car. 
■ Using  a company  car to teach  someone  how to drive.  
■ Leaving  your company  car unlocked,  unattended  or parked  in dangerous  areas.  
■ Allowing  unauthorized  people  to drive  a company  car, unless  an emergency  
mandates  it. 
 
On our part, we will ensure  that our cars are safe and in good  condition,  as well as 
appropriately  insured.  
 
Accidents  
If you are involved  in an accident  with a company  car, contact  our HR department  
immediately,  so we can get in touch  with our insurance  provider.  You shouldn’t accept  
responsibility  or guarantee  payment  to another  person  without  authorization.  
 
Follow  this policy’s  guidelines  to avoid  disciplinary  action.  For minor  offenses,  like 
allowing  unauthorized  people  to drive  a company  car, we will reprimand  you or reclaim 
your car. But for more  serious  offenses,  like causing  an accident  while  intoxicated,  we 
may terminate  you. 
Parking  
We will prioritize  parking  space  assignments  for [employees  with disabilities,  executives  
and employees  who drive  company  vehicles .] We will then allocate  our remaining  
parking  spaces  on a first-come,  first-served  basis.  Interns  and trainees  may also receive  
parking  spaces.  If you want to receive  a parkin g spot,  file your request  with our [HR 
department/  facilities  manager .] 
 
We expect  you to keep  our parking  lot clean  and use only your assigned  space.  Please  
behave  responsibly  to avoid  causing  damage,  injury  or loss of property.  
 
We will not assume  any liability  for theft,  vandalism,  fire or damage  regarding  an 
employee’s  vehicle  in our parking  lot. 
Company -issued  equipment  
As an employee,  you may receive  [company  cell phone,  laptop  or other  device,  
furniture. ] Unless  otherwise  mentioned  in your contract,  any equipment  we offer belongs  
to our company  and you may not sell it or give it away.  You are also responsible  for 
keeping  our equipment  safe and in as good  condition  as possible.  If your equipment  
breaks  or malfunctions,  let us know so we can arrange  to get it repaired.  
 
  
If you are part of our corporate  cell phone  plan,  please  use your phone  within  our plan’s  
restraints.  You may have  to pay any extra  charges  yourself.  
 
Theft  and damage  of company  equipment  
Our equipment  is insured  for theft and damage.  We ask you to inform  us within  [24 
hours ] if your equipment  is stolen  or damaged.  We might  be able to trace  stolen  laptops  
and cell phones.  Please  also file a theft statement  (affidavit)  with the police  and submit  
a copy  to us.  
 
Security  of company  issued  devices  
We advise  you to keep  your company -issued  computer,  tablet  and cell phone  secure.  
You can do this if you: 
 
■ Keep  all devices  password -protected.  
■ Ensure  you do not leave  your devices  unattended.  
■ Install  security  updates  for browsers  and other  systems  as soon  as updates  are 
available.  
■ Log into company  accounts  and systems  through  secure  and private  networks  
only.  
■ Follow  all instructions  for disk encryption,  anti-malware  protection  and password  
management  that you received  along  with your equipment.  
Time  
In this section,  we explain  our provisions  for your working  hours  and time off. We 
include  [five] types  of leave  and holidays.  
Working  hours  
Our company  operates  between  [9 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays .] You may come  to work 
at any time between  [9 a.m. and 11 a.m.], depending  on your team’s  needs.  
 
Some  departments  may work  after hours,  too [(e.g. customer  support,  shipping.) ] If you 
work  in these  departments,  you will follow  a shift schedule  as needed.  
 
 Paid time off (PTO)  
Employees  receive  [20 days ] of Paid Time  Off (PTO)  per year.  You PTO accrual  begins  
the day you join our company  and you receive  [1.7 days  per month .] You can take your 
PTO at any time after your first [week ] with us and you [can] use time off you haven’t  
accrued  yet. You will earn one additional  day per year after your [first year] with our 
company,  with a cap at [25 days  overall. ] 
 
If you want to use PTO,  send  a request  [through  our HRIS. ] If your manager  or HR 
approves,  you are permitted  to take your leave.  You do not have  to specify  a reason  for 
requesting  PTO.  
 
You [can/cannot ] transfer  any remaining  PTO to the next year.  We encourage  you to 
use your time off throughout  the year.  
 
If you leave  our company,  we may compensate  accrued  PTO with your final paycheck  
according  to local law. When  the law doesn’t  have  provisions,  we will compensate  
accrued  leave  to employees  who were  not terminated  for cause.  
Holidays  
Our company  observes  the following  holidays:  
 
■ [New Year’s  Day] 
■ [Martin  Luther  King Day] 
■ [President’s Day] 
■ [Good  Friday/Easter  Monday ] 
■ [Memorial  Day] 
■ [Independence  Day] 
■ [Labor  Day] 
■ [Columbus  Day] 
■ [Veterans  Day] 
■ [Thanksgiving  Day] 
■ [Christmas  Day] 
 
If a holiday  falls on a day when  our company  doesn’ t operate  (e.g. Sunday),  we will  
observe  that holiday  on the closest  business  day.  
 
 
 Our company  offers  a floating  day, which  you can take as a holiday  any day you 
choose.  If you want  to observe  a religious  holiday  that isn’t included  in our list, we may 
allow  you to take unpaid  time off for that day. Or, you may use your PTO.  
 
Holiday  pay 
■ Exempt  employees  are entitled  to their normal  compensation  without  any 
deductions.  
■ Permanent  non-exempt  employees  receive  holiday  pay as a benefit  after they 
have  worked  with us for more  than [three  months .] 
 
Working  on a holiday  
These  holidays  are considered  “off-days”  for most  employees.  If you need  a team  
member  to work  on a holiday,  inform  them  at least  [three  days ] in advance.   
 
If you are a non-exempt  employee , you will receive  your regular  hourly  rate with a 
premium  for working  on a holiday.  If you are an exempt  employee,  we will grant  you an 
additional  day of PTO that you must  take within  [12 months ] after that holiday.  
 
We [will/ won’t ] count  hours  you worke d on a holiday  to decide  whether  you are entitled  
to overtime  pay. 
Sick leave  
We offer [one week ] of [paid] sick leave.  In states  or countries  where  employees  are 
entitled  to a greater  number  of sick leave  days  by law, we will follow  that law. You can 
take sick leave  to recover  from short -term illness,  injuries,  mental  issues  and other  
indisposition.  If you have  the flu or other  contagious  disease,  please  use your sick days.  
 
If you become  sick, inform  your manager  and send  a sick leave  request  [through  our 
HRIS. ] You may take a partial  day off or work  from home,  but we advise  you to rest and 
recuperate  for a day before  returning  to work.

health  care (e.g. doctor’s/dentist ’s appointments.)  
 
Occasionally,  we may ask you to submit  a physician’s  note or other  medical  certification  
and/or  complete  a sick leave  form.  We will do this for insurance  purposes  if you are 
absent  for more  than [three  days ] of sick leave.

off without  deduction  from your salary.  If local or national  law stipulates  more  days  of

 Leaving  our company  
In this section,  we describe  our procedures  regarding  resignation  and termination  of our 
employees.  We also refer to our progressive  discipline  process  that may sometimes  
result  in termination.  
 
[Insert  this if employees  are in the U.S: We remind  you that in the U.S. employment  is 
“at-will.” This means  that you or our company  may terminate  our employment  
relationship  at any time and for any non-discriminatory  reason. ] 
Progressive  discipline  
Here  we outline  steps  we will take to address  employee  misconduct.  We want  to give 
employees  a chance  to correct  their behavior  when  possible  and assist  them  in doing  
so. We also want  to ensure  that we thoroughly  investigate  and hand le serious  offenses.  
 
Our progressive  discipline  process  has six steps  of increasing  severity.  These  steps  
are: 
i. Verbal  warning  
ii. Informal  meeting  with supervisor  
iii. Formal  reprimand  
iv. Formal  disciplinary  meeting  
v. Penalties  
vi. Termination  
 
Different  offenses  correspon d to different  steps  in our disciplinary  process.  For example,  
minor,  one-time offenses  (e.g. breach  of our dress  code  policy)  will trigger  Step 1. More  
severe  violations  (e.g. sexual  harassment)  will trigger  step 5. 
 
If you manage  employees,  inform  them  when you launch  a progressive  discipline  
process.  Pointing  out a performance  issue  is not necessarily  a verbal  warning  and may 
be part of your regular  feedback.  If you judge  that progressive  discipline  is appropriate,  
let your team  member  know  and ask HR to help you explain  our full procedure.   
 
Managers  may skip or repeat  steps  at their discretion.  Our company  may treat 
circumstances  differently  from that described  in this policy.  But, we are always  obliged  
to act fairly  and lawfully  and document  every  stage of our progressive  discipline  
process.  
 
Keep  in mind  that our company  isn’t obliged  to follow  the steps  of our progressive  
discipline  process.  As you are employed  “at-will” in the U.S, we may terminate  you 
 
 directly  without  launching  a progressive  discipl ine process.  For serious  offenses  (e.g. 
sexual  harassment),  we may terminate  you without  warning.  
Resignation  
You resign  when  you voluntarily  inform  HR or your manager  that you will stop working  
for our company.  We also consider  you resigned  if you don’t  come to work  for [three ] 
consecutive  days  without  notice.  
 
You are not obliged  to give us advance  notice  before  resigning.  But, for efficiency’s  
sake,  and to make  sure our workplace  runs smoothly,  we ask that you give at least  [two 
weeks ] notice,  if possibl e. If you hold a highly  specialized  or executive  position,  we ask 
that you give us at least  [a month’s ] notice,  when  possible.  
 
We accept  verbal  resignations,  but we prefer  that you submit  a written  and signed  
notice  of resignation  for our HR records.  We will reply  with an acceptance  of resignation  
letter  within  [two days .] HR will inform  your manager  that you are resigning  if you 
haven’t  already  done  so. Whether  you want to announce  your resignation  to your team  
is up to you, but we encourage  you to be open. 
Tuition  or relocation  reimbursement  
If you have  relocated  or studied  at our company’s  expense,  you are bound  by your 
contract  to remain  with us for at least  [two years .] If you resign  before  that period,  you 
may have  to reimburse  us for part or all of these  expenses.  
Forced  resignation  
You can resign  anytime  at your own free will and nobody  should  force  you into 
resignation.  Forcing  someone  into resigning  (directly  or indirectly)  is constructive  
dismissal  and we won’t  tolerate  it. Specifically,  we prohi bit employees  from:  
■ Creating  a hostile  or unpleasant  environment.  
■ Demanding  or coaxing  an employee  to resign.  
■ Victimizing,  harassing  or retaliating  against  an employee.  
■ Forcing  an employee  to resign  by taking  unofficial  adverse  actions  (e.g. 
demotions,  increased  workload).  
Termination  
Terminating  an employee  is always  unpleasant  but sometimes  necessary.  If that 
happens,  we want  to ensure  we act lawfully  and respectfully.  
 
  
We may terminate  an employee  either  for cause  or without  cause.  
■ For cause  termination  is justified  when  an employee  breaches  their contract,  
engages  in illegal  activities  (e.g. embezzlement),  disrupts  our workplace  (e.g. 
harasses  colleagues),  performs  below  acceptable  standards  or causes  damage  
or financial  loss to our company.  
 
■ Without  cause termination  refers  to redundancies  or layoffs  that may be 
necessary  if we cease  some  of our operations  or re-assign  job duties  within  
teams.  We will follow  applicable  laws regarding  notice  and payouts.  
 
We will offer severance  pay to eligible  employees.  We may also help employees  who 
were  terminated  without  cause  to find work  elsewhere,  if possible.   
 
We may also compensate  accrued  vacation  and sick leave  upon  termination,  depending  
on local law. Whenever  local law doesn’t  have  relevant  stipulations,  we will pay accrued  
leave  only to those  who weren’t  terminated  for cause.  We will also take into account  
union  agreements  and abide  by agreed  terms.  
 
If you manage  team  members,  avoid  wrongful  dismissal.  When  you terminate  an 
employee  for cause,  we expect  you to be certain  you made  the right choice  and keep  
accurate  performance  and/or  disciplinary  records  to support  your decision.  
References  
When  we terminate  employees,  we may provide  references  for those  who leave  in good  
standing.  This means  that employees  shouldn’t  have  been  terminated  for cause.  If you 
are laid off, you may receive  references.  Please  ask your manager.  
 
If you resign,  you may ask for references  and your manager  has a right to oblige  or 
refuse.  
Policy  revision  
We will always  strive  for fairne ss and equal  opportunity  and penalize  offensive  and 
illegal  behaviors.  But, as laws and our environment  change,  we may revise  and modify  
some  of our policies.   
 
We have  established  an [annual ] revision  of our handbook  to bring  it up to date with 
legislation  and employment  trends.  We also ask you to contact  HR if you spot any 
 
 inconsistencies  or mistakes.  And, if you have  any ideas  about  how to improve  our 
workplace,  we are happy  to hear them.  
Employee  acknowledgement  
Please  sign to acknowledge  that you’ve  read this handbook  and that you are committed  
to following  our policies.  If you need  any clarifications,  feel free to ask HR.
